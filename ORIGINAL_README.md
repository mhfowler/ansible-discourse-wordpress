# Ansible-discourse

Provisioning [Discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse) with Vagrant, Ansible, [Discourse Docker](https://github.com/discourse/discourse_docker) and AWS.

* For the installation on AWS see section [Deployment on AWS](#deployment-on-aws)
* For local installation with vagrant see section [Local Deployment with Vagrant](#local-deployment-with-vagrant)

# Local Deployment with Vagrant

## Requirements

* Vagrant (tested with *1.8.1*)
* Ansible (tested with *1.9.3*)


## Basic Setup

1) Clone this project:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:xpeppers/ansible-discourse.git
```

2) Add an entry to your `/etc/hosts` file that maps the domain `discourse.dev` to the IP of the virtual machine:

```
192.168.11.3    discourse.dev
```

3) Start the virtual machine with vagrant:

```
vagrant up
```

4) Install the ansible roles (execute from the host machine):

```
[sudo] ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

5) Edit playbooks/roles/discourse/files/app.yml file filling <> parameters:

6) (Optional) Configure backup:

```
cp playbooks/roles/discourse/files/backup.cron.template.sh playbooks/roles/discourse/files/backup.cron.sh
```

Fill the API key in `backup.cron.sh` with the key you find here: https://<DISCOURSE_HOST>/admin/api/keys

7) (Optional) If you want to change the default (`/var/discourse`) installation directory of Discourse, you can change the value in `playbooks/vars/main.yml` and change the value of volumes in `app.yml` too.


## Provisioning

Provision with

```
# Vagrant host
scripts/provision_vagrant
# or
scripts/provision_vagrant_only_machine
# or
scripts/provision_vagrant_only_discourse

# AWS host
scripts/provision_aws
# or
scripts/provision_aws_only_machine
```


## Utility scripts

### Manual/Automatic Backups

Run this command to trigger a backup:

```
scripts/cmd_aws "sudo sh /home/discourse/backup.cron.sh"
```

Additionally there is a cron configured that runs automatic backups at 9:00, 14:00 and 20:00. For additional configuration see `playbooks/roles/discourse/tasks/main.yml`.



### Gather info about the machine

```
scripts/info_vagrant

# or

scripts/info_aws
```



### Machine logs

```
scripts/logs_vagrant

# or

scripts/logs_aws
```

### Execute arbitrary commands

```
scripts/cmd_aws "ls -lh /var/discourse"
scripts/cmd_aws "sudo docker ps"

scripts/cmd_aws [YOUR-PEM-LOCATION] "sudo docker ps"
```

# Deployment on AWS

## Prerequisities

1. [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
2. Have AWS access key and secret key with proper administrator permissions
3. [Packer](https://www.packer.io/)
4. [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) (tested with 2.3.*)

## Steps

1. Make sure to `git clone --recursive https://github.com/xpeppers/ansible-discourse.git` to fetch also all the git submodules
2. Edit the `app.yml` file and then copy it under the proper folder: ```cp app.yml ./playbooks/roles/discourse/files```
3a. Run Packer to build the AMI without assume role and MFA: ```packer build -var 'aws_access_key=<ACCESS_KEY>' -var 'aws_secret_key=<SECRET_KEY>' packer-silver-image.json```
3b. Run Packer to build the AMI with assume role and MFA: ```AWS_MFA=<mfa_code_here> AWS_PROFILE=<aws_profile_name> packer build packer-silver-image.json```
4. Take note of the AMI id created by Packer
5. Edit the `cloudformation/ec2-parameters.json` file, updating the AMI id as generated by Packer in the previous step
6. Update the stack with CloudFormation (replacing first the placeholders in this command): ```aws cloudformation update-stack --profile <AWS-PROFILE> --stack-name <STACK_NAME> --template-body file://cloudformation/ec2.yml --parameters file://cloudformation/ec2-parameters.json --region <REGION> --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM```
7. Wait for CloudFormation to updates the stack (it should takes few minutes)
